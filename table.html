                        If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place.
                        When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough,
                        the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. 
                        We created the Random Paragraph Generator with you in mind. 
                        The process is quite simple. Choose the number of random paragraphs
                        you'd like to see and click the button. Your chosen number of paragraphs
                            will instantly appear.
                            While it may not be obvious to everyone,
                            there are a number of reasons creating random
                            paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people
                            use this generator are listed in the following paragraphs.

                            Love in such situations is rarely real. Sex is the engine,
                            exalting and ruining people, sex and frustration. Love is what
                            people believe is worth the path of devastation.
